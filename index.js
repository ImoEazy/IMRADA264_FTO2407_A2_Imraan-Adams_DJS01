//* Debugging Guide
// * 1. Make the code more readable
// * 2. Pick up calculation errors
// * 3. Make these calculations robust such that the calculation does not give an incorrect result, it throws an error to the user if something has gone wrong (parameter used with an incorrect unit of measurement, etc)
 //*//

// Given Parameters
///const vel = 10000; // velocity (km/h)
///const acc = 3; // acceleration (m/s^2)
///const time = 3600; // seconds (1 hour)
///const d = 0; // distance (km)
///const fuel = 5000; // remaining fuel (kg)
///const fbr = 0.5; // fuel burn rate (kg/s)


///const d2 = d + (vel*time) //calcultes new distance
///const rf = fbr*time //calculates remaining fuel
///const vel2 = calcNewVel(acc, vel, time) //calculates new velocity based on acceleration

// Pick up an error with how the function below is called and make it robust to such errors
///calcNewVel = (vel, acc, time) => { 
  ///return vel + (acc*time)
///}

//console.log(`Corrected New Velocity: ${vel2} km/h`);
//console.log(`Corrected New Distance: ${d2} km`);
//console.log(`Corrected Remaining Fuel: ${rf} kg`);

// Given Parameters
const spacecraft = {
  vel: 10000, // velocity (km/h)
  acc: 3,     // acceleration (m/s^2)
  time: 3600, // seconds (1 hour)
  d: 0,       // initial distance (km)
  fuel: 5000, // initial fuel (kg)
  fbr: 0.5    // fuel burn rate (kg/s)
};

// Function allows  convertion of km/h to m/s kms times 3.6
//Unit conversion constant. allows for use throughout functions
const kmhToMs = (kmh) => kmh * 1000 / 3600;

// Function to calculate new velocity
const calcNewVel = ({ vel, acc, time }) => {
  const initialVelMs = kmhToMs(vel); // Convert initial velocity to m/s
  return (initialVelMs + (acc * time)) * 3600 / 1000; // Convert back to km/h times 3.6
};

// Function to calculate new distance
const calcNewDistance = ({ vel, time }) => {
  const initialVelMs = kmhToMs(vel); // Convert velocity to m/s
  return (initialVelMs * time) / 1000; // Convert to km
};

// Function to calculate remaining fuel for error handling
const calcRemainingFuel = ({ fbr, time, fuel }) => {
  const remainingFuel = fuel - (fbr * time);
  if (remainingFuel < 0) {//if fuel number below zero
    throw new Error("insuffecient fuel level");
  }
  return remainingFuel; //return remain fule value
};

// Perform calculations
try {
  const newVelocity = calcNewVel(spacecraft);// calculates the new velocity
  const newDistance = calcNewDistance(spacecraft);// calculates new distance
  const remainingFuel = calcRemainingFuel(spacecraft);// Calculates the reemainig fuel

  console.log(`Corrected New Velocity: ${newVelocity.toFixed(2)} km/h`);
  console.log(`Corrected New Distance: ${newDistance.toFixed(2)} km`);
  console.log(`Corrected Remaining Fuel: ${remainingFuel.toFixed(2)} kg`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}









//Key Issues:
//Unit Mismatch: The velocity is in km/h, while acceleration is in m/sÂ². We need to convert the velocity to m/s for consistent calculations.
//Function Definition: The calcNewVel function is called before it's defined. We should define it first.
//Calculations: The distance calculation needs to consider the new velocity correctly after conversion.

//Changes Made:
//Unit Conversion: A separate function kmhToMs is added to convert velocity from km/h to m/s.
//Function Order: The calcNewVel, calcNewDistance, and calcRemainingFuel functions are defined before they are called.
//Parameter Destructuring: Each function uses parameter destructuring for clarity and ease of access.
//Error Handling: Added error handling for the fuel calculation to ensure it doesn't go negative.
//Expected Output
//This refactored code will give you the corrected new velocity, distance, and remaining fuel while ensuring proper unit handling and clear function structure
